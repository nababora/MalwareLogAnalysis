# MalwareLogAnalysis

Malware log analysis based on Branch data.

Relative Presentation is [here](https://goo.gl/DLzLfo).

**Branch data** refers to the data logged at a **branching instruction** such as jmp and **call**. This data is advantageous for showing the structure of a binary regardless of a polymorphism.

**[BranchLogPreprocess](https://github.com/revsic/MalwareLogAnalysis/blob/master/BranchLogPreprocess.ipynb)** preprocess the raw branch logs of malware and normal software to **regularized data**. Then **classifying malware** and normal software with the branch data. **Machine Learning model** at **[MalwareLogAnalysis](https://github.com/revsic/MalwareLogAnalysis/blob/master/BranchLogPreprocess.ipynb)**.

- **Analysis** : Processing utils for log analysis.
- **Cuckoo** : Customization of [Cuckoo sandbox](https://github.com/cuckoosandbox/cuckoo) for automation of the malware branching.
- **Data** : API List called by malware. ML dataset.
- **Log** : Raw log of the branch data.
- **[BranchTracer](https://github.com/revsic/BranchTracer)** : Branch tracer based on VEH for logging branch data.

## Analysis

Processing utils for log analysis.

- maldb.py : Create database for the branch logs.
- preproc.py : Log regularizer for feeding ML model.

**Malware database**

| id | name |
| -- | ---- |
| ID | Malware Name based on VirusTotal |

**Branch database**

| Column | Comment |
| ------ | ------- |
| id | ID |
| malware_id | Malware ID |
| order | Order of the branch data generated from the same malware |
| src_addr | Source Address |
| dst_addr | Destination Address |
| dll | Destination DLL Space (Nullable) |
| symbol | Destination Symbol Data (Nullable) |

**Preprocessing**

Regularize raw log. Filter out API symbol data and map to one-based symbol index given by function_list.txt.

For example, calc's preprocessed branch data is [0,186,0,143,187,0,292]. First column is ```is_malware``` flag. **if 1 then malware else normal** software. Following column is the **one-based index of the API function** based on function_list.txt. **If index is 0**, it represent the **function_list.txt doesn't have** such function.

## Cuckoo

Customization of Cuckoo sandbox for automation of the malware branching.

<img src="md_image/cuckoo_structure.png" width="60%">

It is a schematic representation of the structure of the Cuckoo Sandbox. When we **submit** the malware to the Cuckoo sandbox, **scheduler recieve** the malware. It sent malware to the vm that does not work or put it into the que. The **```agent.py``` of the VM** receive it and start the **```analyzer.py``` to analyze malware**. It makes the **report** and sent it to the scheduler.

I customize the ```analyzer.py``` to run the branch tracer. **Helper** inject the **Brancher dll** to the target software and Brancher log the branch data.

```Python
if is32bit:
    self.target = 'C:\\dbg\\Helper32.exe'
else:
    self.target = 'C:\\dbg\\Helper64.exe'

try:
    proc = Popen(self.target)
    pids = proc.pid
except Exception as e:
    log.error('custom : fail to open process %s : %s', self.target, e)
```

After run the software, ```analyzer.py``` preprocess the log and write it on the debug log of the Cuckoo sandbox.

```Python
time.sleep(3)
with open('C:\\dbg\\log.txt') as f_log:
    raw = f_log.read()
    data = ''.join(raw.split('\x00'))
    log.debug('logged : \n%s', data)
```

The ```./cuckoo/filter.py``` parse the branch data and make a new log file of the software's log data.

```Python
with open(analysis_path % filt) as f:
    log = f.read()

if '+' not in log:
    shutil.rmtree('./' + filt)
else:
    liner = log.replace('\r', '').split('\n')
    branch = filter(lambda x: '+' in x, liner)
    data = '\n'.join(branch)

    with open(log_path % filt, 'w') as branch_log:
        branch_log.write(data + '\n')
```

## Data

Top 1000 Windows API called by malware samples processed by malware db of ```analysis``` module,

I collect 470 malware branch data and 40 normal software branch data. It's very unbalanced classification problem, so I make dataset seperately ```mal_trainset.csv (450)```, ```norm_trainset.csv (20)``` except ```testset.csv (20+20)```. Then train 20 malware trainset and whole normal trainset as a one batch.

## Branch Tracer

Branch Tracer based on Vectored Exception Handler. **Here is my [repo](https://github.com/revsic/BranchTracer).**

## MalwareLogAnalysis

Classification problem between malware and normal software. Preprocessed branch data is used to dataset.

<img src="md_image/model.png" width="70%">

First, project the index number to 1024 vectors. Then pass it to the LSTM reucrrent unit of 1024 hidden units. Connect to Fully-connected layer (512, 256, 2) and softmax the result.

I was able to get a classifier with **92% accuracy**.

## Benefit

Unlike existing detection method, it use branch data to detect malware. **Branch data represent** a structure as a small view, **behavior** as a larger view of a binary, and it can carry on the definition that **malware do malicious acts**.

*Theoritically, if you can extract the branch data, it will be able to detect most malware*.
